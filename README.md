# Contrastive-Learning
Implementation of SimCLR no CIFAR 10 using torch
# SimCLR on CIFAR-10

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of SimCLR, a state-of-the-art contrastive learning method, applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to learn robust image representations by maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same image while minimizing similarity with other views in the dataset.

## Features
- SimCLR implementation for contrastive learning
- Training on the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization
